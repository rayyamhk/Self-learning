# Pytorch self-learning
- 01-MNIST: A simple 3-layer LeNet-like NN for MNIST dataset. It supports training, inference, exporting checkpoints, and loading checkpoints.
- 02-TinyResNet: A 6-layer ResNet-like NN with skip-connection.
- 03-ResNet: PyTorch implementation of ResNets (20, 34, 50, 101) based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf.
- 04-Train.py: A generic train and inference functions.
