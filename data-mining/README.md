# Data Mining: Association Analysis
- Apriori: Frequent pattern mining.
- FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm): It compresses the whole dataset into a compact tree structure (FP-tree) and applies in-memory and FP-tree-based frequent pattern mining method.
- GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern Algotirhm): Sequence mining based on Apriori algorithm.
